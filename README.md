# EEMB146-Final-Project
Final Project for UCSB's EEMB 146, Biometry. The project uses statistical analysis to investigate if changes in environmental conditions effects plant root:shoot ratio. 

Abstract: 
Soil communities have profound impacts on their surrounding habitats and play a critical role in maintaining the stability of Earth’s ecosystems. Thus, it is essential that the health of these communities is preserved as environmental conditions change in light of climate change. To understand how soil-microbe interactions may be effected by climate change, researchers at Stockholm University and the Ohio State University conducted an experiment in which seeds/plants were exposed to different temperature and soil moisture conditions. Motivated by a personal love for preserving the environment and fascination with microbes, I focused on the variables “temperature manipulation type” and “Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) percent colonization” from the data set to investigate how these variables effect the “plant root:shoot ratio” variable. The data was analyzed with a two-sample t-test using the categorical variable of temperature manipulation type, and a linear regression model using the numeric variable of AMF percent colonization. The results of these statistical analyses conclude that temperature does have a significant impact on plant root:shoot ratio, and AMF percent colonization is a significant predictor of root:shoot ratio.
